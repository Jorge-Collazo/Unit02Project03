            <h1>Decide the Fate of the World!</h1>
            <p>Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide 
                    the outcome. As one of the world powers 
                    battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
                     military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
                    You have to form alliances and then betray your 
                    allies before they betray you!</p>
            <p>Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
                    of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
                   raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
                   with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
                   move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
                   the conflict.</p>
            <p>
                    The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
                    Buy armaments and develop secret 
                    weapons from your country's economic funds and 
                    natural reserves, but be sure to save 
                    something for the future.</p>

            <h1>Alliance Ratings</h1>
            <h2>Decent Game but Many are Better</h2>
            <p>Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
                    game play to be robust and engaging. The 
                    rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
                    experience in this class of board games, there 
                    is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
                    think the battle simulation cards are some of 
                    the best we have encountered.</p>
            <p>All of that being said, the competition for this type 
                    of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
                    established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
                    exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
                    that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
                    to draw our attention away from games like 
                    Battle Tested and Global Conflict.</p>

                    <li>Setup takes too Long</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored.</p>
