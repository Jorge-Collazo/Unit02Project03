            <h1>Decide the Fate of the World!</h1>
            <p>Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide 
                    the outcome. As one of the world powers 
                    battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
                     military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
                    You have to form alliances and then betray your 
                    allies before they betray you!</p>
            <p>Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
                    of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
                   raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
                   with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
                   move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
                   the conflict.</p>
            <p>
                    The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
                    Buy armaments and develop secret 
                    weapons from your country's economic funds and 
                    natural reserves, but be sure to save 
                    something for the future.</p>
